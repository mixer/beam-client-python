This is a basic chat bot framework for Beam, built to serve as a basic example of a Beam chat bot.

## Usage

We've built a chat bot that logs incoming messages to the console, and sends "Hi!" to the channel every second.

To use it, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. Then:

- install dependencies (`python setup.py install`)
- copy `config.example.py` to `config.py` and add your authentication information
- run the example chatbot (`python example.py`)
